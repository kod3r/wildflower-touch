# wildflower-touch

A [Wildflower](https://github.com/pschanely/wildflower) IDE for touch devices.

This is a hack.  It really doesn't work yet.  Don't try to use it.  That said, if you're interested in this sort of thing, I'd love to hear from you.

Here's a demo of me implementing the solution to [problem one](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) of Project Euler (finding the multiples of 3 and 5 up to some limit and taking their sum):

Pure functional languages let us do some pretty great things in the IDE.  More people should be talking about that.  Here's one: given any value in a test, trace it back to the point in the code where it first appeared:
